/*
For each account that has automatic payments setup (so stripe_usage_subscription is
set in the accounts table), and their most recent recent statement with interval "month"
has both fields automatic_payment and paid_purchase_id null and a negative balance,
we charge for the amount of the negative balance.

We restrict to automatic_payment null to ensure a payment didn't get attempted
and paid_purchase_id null in case somehow the user manually made the payment.
E.g., you could imagine a situation where automatic payments aren't setup,
user makes a payment, then sets up automatic payments.

If the charge goes through, then the user will get credited to the account and
the subscriptions, etc. will get renewed.
