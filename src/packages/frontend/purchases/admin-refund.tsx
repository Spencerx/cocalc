/*
Show a Refund... button.  When clicked, shows modal to enter reason and notes,
and submit the refund.  The backend then has stripe do the refund, and also creates
a service="refund" transaction.

NOTE: we do not implement partial refunds, since it's **really complicated** to even
figure out *what* to refund, due to sales tax, currency conversion rates, etc.  If we ever
need to deal with that, maybe something can be done manually.  It's pretty rare,
and can at least be done via stripe directly in terms of providing money back,
and we could manually create a corresponding refund transaction to match that.
I had implemented this and realized that its super hard to get right given tax, etc.

            The above information is visible to the user. When you click OK,
            their money will be refunded in 5-10 days, and their CoCalc
            transactions log and statement will include a new "Refund" entry
            immediately (click Refresh to confirm). If they have an email
            address configured, they will also be sent an email. Stripe's fees
            for the original payment won't be returned, but there are no
            additional fees for the refund. This refund will use the latest
            Stripe-provided exchange rate, which may differ from the original
            rate. (Partial refunds are not implemented.)
